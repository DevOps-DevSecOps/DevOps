[Development]
When work starts most developers and programmers will have Development Environments set up for the work. This is where they can build and verify the work they are doing.
Developers and programmers use the development server to test code directly.
This server is usually set up with the needed hardware, software and other necessary parts for debugging and deploying.

[Testing]
Once the developers or programmers complete the work they will deploy that finished work to a test server.
A test servers set up and configurations will be for internal use by the team with necessary configurations.
The internal team completes the testing phase, usually with the use of a QA Tester.
The tester will run various use cases to ensure that the product is functioning as it should.
If the tester discovers bugs or other issues, they will create tasks for the developers or programmers to fix.

[User Acceptance Testing (UAT)]
When work passes through the internal testing phase and is ready for approvals, the team deploys it to a UAT server.
Once in the server the work will get final client approvals before flipping the switch.
The fundamental difference between a UAT and Test server is that UAT is configured to run as a production build.
This server will be set up in an environment that the client will be using.
By doing this, a client will be able to access the product on this server.
Along with being able to use it and see a real-time view of what the product will look like.
The client will be able to check that the features they requested are working according to their original thoughts.
If the client does not like their original thought on a feature in UAT, they determine whether they want to launch as-is or change the way something is working.

[Staging]
Staging is for pre-deployment.
A staging serverâ€™s set up is like production with all production configurations and the team uses it to perform smoke testing.
This ensures the code and everything works in a production configuration and architecture.
Once the UI Developer, Backend Developer, DevOps and Database Administration check everything and its an all-go from each, they push the code to production.

[Demo]
Demo servers are not as common as the other servers, but in certain situations, there may be a request from a client to set up a demo server.
When complete final work and the client approves it, it may be deployed to a demo server.
The use of this server is primarily for showcasing the product to key stakeholders and potential or existing customers.
A sales and marketing team will usually use this server to promote the product and allow prospects and leads to interact with the product.

[Production]
Production servers are the final location for all finished and approved work.
When you deploy code to a production server, this means everyone has approved it to go live.
Work should never be done on a production server without the use of some type of version control as this will be a high risk for things breaking while the product is in use.
In certain situations, when a product goes offline or a production server goes down, it can cost a company a lot of money and this is definitely not something anyone wants to occur.
